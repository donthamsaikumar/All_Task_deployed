            <h1>CHAPTER1</h1>
            <p>
            Lord Krishna or Shri Krishna is most often worshipped in the forms of

Bal Krishna (An infant)
Gopala (A mischievous young boy)
Vasudeva (A human-being evolved to the stage of God-hood)
Yogeshwar (One who has realized the Ultimate Self)
Describing the different forms Lord Krishna is worshipped in, Param Pujya Dadashri said, “Some have labeled Him ‘The One with a flute’; some call Him ‘The One with Gopis.’ But Lord Krishna cannot be fully understood that way.”
Beyond the above-mentioned forms, Param Pujya Dadashri explained that Lord Krishna was a manifested God living in continuous awareness and an exalted Self-realized stage; He was a Vasudeva Narayan, a Yogeshwar, and one of the 63 Shalaka Purusha (one with super-human abilities and achievements).
As Arjun’s guide on the Mahabharata battlefield, it was Lord Krishna’s duty to address his (Arjun's) despondency. In order to do so, the Lord began by revealing His true, divine Self: "Arjun, you have known Me for a long time, yet you haven't known Me in the true sense. What you see before you is My physical body, not the true Self. I am separate from this body. I am Atma (the Self).

            Param Pujya Dadashri elaborated that, “Lord Krishna said, ‘The ‘material’ within is precisely what I am - that actually is Krishna.’ You will find what you are searching for if you recognize Him (beyond the “packing” of the body). The entire inner intent of Shri Krishna is contained within these two words (material and packing).”

Using the subject of death to further illustrate this, Param Pujya Dadashri explained that what departs at the time of death is the inner “material” (Atma, or the Self), and what remains behind is the discarded “packing” of the body. While Lord Krishna’s “packing” was of Vasudeva Narayan, there are infinite varieties of packing for the living beings of the world – plant-forms, animal-forms, the human-form, etc.
Guiding further, Lord Krishna enlightened Arjun with the knowledge of the Self existing within Him, and within all living beings – including those he (Arjun) must now face in battle.

"Just as I am Atma (the Self), you too are Atma. The brothers, uncles, teachers, and friends whom you are facing in the battle are also Atma.”

Shri Krishna continued, “Arjun, this battle is your karmic destiny, and you must carry it out with the awareness of the Atma within all. If you remain in this awareness and fight the war, you will not bind any new karma and your remaining karmas will exhaust. This will lead to ultimate salvation.

    “In the ‘Gita’, it is said, ‘Whenever the Earth becomes heavily burdened with demerit karmas, I will take birth.’ Who is this ‘I’?”

Param Pujya Dadashri explained that, “That ‘I’ refers to the real Self. It is a principle that when there is an increase of demerit karmas on Earth, a Great Being will take birth. In this way, in every yuga (time cycle), a Great Being is born.”

“Na Kartutva, Na Karmani, Lokshya Shrujati Prabhu:
Na Karmaphal Sanyog, Svabhavas Tu Pravartate!”

“The Lord does not act, nor does He induce anyone to act, nor does He give the fruits of action. All this happens naturally.”

Param Pujya Dadashri elaborated that, “Shri Krishna said that the world has arisen naturally; it is all happening naturally. The world is running naturally, and it is being run by an energy called Vyavasthit Shakti (result of Scientific Circumstantial Evidences). Vyavasthit Shakti is not the creator of the world. Vyavasthit Shakti is natural and eternal.”

    When questioned about the different forms in which Shri Krishna may be worshipped, Param Pujya Dadashri recommended the worship of Bal Krishna statue to those who desire worldly benefit. To those desirous of moksha (liberation from the cycles of birth and death), He recommended worshipping the Self-knowledge expounded by Yogeshwara Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.

    Param Pujya Dadashri further explained that, “When a person devotes himself to a murti (idol), he remains the idol - the formed non-self complex; when a person devotes himself to the Amurta (formless), he attains the formless Self and becomes liberated. Shree Krishna said, ‘You actually are Lord Krishna (the Paramatma).’ But how will this be understood unless you have attained the knowledge of the Self?”
    
    Param Pujya Dadashri concluded by saying, “You need the religion of Yogeshwar Krishna; it is a temple of Gnan (Self-knowledge). Lord Krishna was a Gnani (embodiment of Self-knowledge). He became enlightened. He became a Gnani Purush (Narayan) from an ordinary human being (nara).”
